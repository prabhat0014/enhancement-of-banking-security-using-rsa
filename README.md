# Enhancement of Banking Security using RSA

This project proposed an implementation of a complete and practical RSA encrypt/decrypt
solution on enhancing banking security.

### MODULE EXPLANATION
The software system has the following subsystems:
- Admin/login
- Splash-Sceen
- User/Login
- Create Record
- View Record
- Update Record
- Transaction
- Logout/Exit

### EXECUTION
To execute this code you need to install the following libraries:
- RSA <br>
pip install rsa
- STDIOMASK <br>
pip install stdiomask

### CONCLUSION
The main aim of this project is to enhance security of bank using RSA algorithm and make
it as secure as possible so that it is not easily broken by intruders and our information
and money are not lost. As e-commerce has grown drastically these days, information is
most important as most of the transactions are made by credit cards and the customer intends
to send his money easily and more securely.
